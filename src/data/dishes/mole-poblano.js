  description:
    "Mole Poblano is a type of sauce well beloved in and out of Mexico, usually poured over turkey. Though it may take days to prepare properly its spicy flavor and appealing texture make for a delicious dinnertime meal.<br />  ",
  history:
    'Heralded as the "pinnacle of Mexican cooking tradition" (Coe. and Coe., 2013), this dish may be able to trace its roots all the way back to the Aztec Empire. Originating around 1680 in the Puebla region of Mexico, this dish was once shunned by the elites of New Spain, who refused to give up the palate of their home continent. (Coe. and Coe., 2013).<br />Today, Pavo en Mole Poblano is "served all over the republic on truly festive occasions" (Ortiz, 1994).',
  notes: ["Today, there are over 300 variants of the mole sauce."],
