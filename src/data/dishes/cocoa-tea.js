  description:
    "Cocoa tea is a staple of Carribean breakfasts. With its strong flavors and high temperature, it’d be tempting to compare it to coffee, but the big difference is the main ingredient: roasted cocoa nibs. The flavor is then enhanced by dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg.<br />",
  history: "",
  notes: [
    "The most common way to make this on the island of St. Lucia involves a cacao stick: roasted, shelled, and crushed cacao beans pressed together and shaped into a log. They're usually 100% cacao, but sometimes flavorings like cinnamon or nutmeg are added.",
