      "In the bowl of a food processor, add the flour, sugar, and butter and pulse until the butter has broken down into large pea-sized pieces. Add the egg yolks and 3 tablespoons of ice-cold water and pulse until the dough naturally pulls away from the sides, pulsing in more water, 1 tablespoon at a time as needed to make a cohesive mass. ",
      "Transfer the dough onto a clean work surface and press it into a disk about 6 inches in diameter. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight. ",
      "Meanwhile, make the filling: In a medium skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. When the oil shimmers, add the beef and salt and cook, stirring frequently. until the meat is browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer the beef and any grease to a heat resistant bowl and set aside to cool completely. ",
      "In the clean bowl of the food processor, add the almonds and pulse until they are coarsely chopped. Add the chopped candied fruit, chocolate, and sugar, then continue pulsing until the ingredients have the consistency of a coarse, moist meal, about 30 seconds. Add the cooled beef, cinnamon, and nutmeg and pulse 2–3 times to combine. Transfer the filling into a large bowl and stir in the egg whites to combine. Set aside. ",
      "Preheat the oven to 350°F and line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Unwrap the dough and lightly flour a third large sheet of parchment paper and a rolling pin. Place the dough on the floured parchment and roll it out to an even sheet ⅛ of an inch thick. Using a 2-inch round cutter, cut the dough into 32 circles. Add 1½ teaspoons of the filling to the top third of each circle. Use a paring knife to cut a 1-inch slit horizontally into the center of the bottom third of each circle. Fold each circle in half, pressing the air out with your thumbs and evening the filling out within each cookie (it is fine if some of the filling peeks out through the cut in the dough). Crimp the edges with a fork or your fingers to seal them, then transfer the cookies, cut side up, to the lined baking sheets, taking care to leave at least 1½ inches between each cookie. ",
      "In a small bowl, beat the egg with 1 tablespoon cold water. Brush the top and sides of each cookie with the egg wash, then bake, rotating the baking sheets once halfway through, until the edges of the cookies are a light golden brown, 15–17 minutes. ",
      "Remove the baking sheets and let the cookies cool on the sheets for 5 minutes. Then transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. Once fully cooled, dust with powdered sugar and serve.",

  description: "A unique classic from Modica, Italy, 'Mpanatigghi is reminiscent of the Spanish Empanada. It uses the same familiar semicircle shape, but with a small cut-out “window” that showcases the filling’s sweet-and-savory combo. They are commonly enjoyed with coffee as a breakfast treat.<br />",

  notes: ["It's believed that both these filled cookies and their names are derived from the Spanish <i>empanada</i>.", "Artusi's 1981 cookbook <i>Science in the Kitchen and the Art of Eating Well</i> includes a recipe for Milan Pie, which shares some traits with these cookies."],
