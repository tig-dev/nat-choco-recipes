Add dry ingredients to the egg mixture, whisking them in carefully. Spread the sponge batter evenly on the tray and bake for 8-10 minutes.",
      "When the sponge is baked, first let it cool and then cut in two 15x25cm pieces.",
      "To prepare the top layer, mix the jam with rum and spread it over one sponge. Then melt the chocolate with oil over bain-marie or in the microwave. Pour the ganache over the rum-spiked sponge. Refrigerate for about 30 minutes or until the chocolate is set. Slice the ganache-topped sponge into 15 5cm/2in squares.",
      "To make the filling, soak the gelatine in water for 5 minutes. Mix the powdered sugar with cocoa. Beat the whipping cream and then mix it well with the gelatine, adding the dry ingredients and vanilla extract. Mix until well incorporated.",
      "Evenly spread the filling over the bottom sponge and then finish the cake by assembling the ganache-glazed sponge squares on top of the filling. Refrigerate until the filling is set. Slice the cubes just before serving.",

  description:
    "Rigó Jancsi is a traditional Hungarian torte. A fluffy chocolate mousse, with or without rum, is wrapped in two layers of chocolate sponge cake. Then, the stack is topped with a glaze and/or a dark chocolate ganache, depending on where the source of the recipe.<br />Once baked, Rigó Jancsi is traditionally cube-shaped, but can be cut into any shape desired.",
  history:
    "Though its origins are muddled, we do know that the Rigó Jancsi was named after the famous Romani restaurant violinist that wooed Clara Ward, the Belgian princess. The cake is considered to be Hungarian, but two of its creation myths would place it elsewhere. It was invented around 1900, during Rigó and Clara's romance, but whether it was made by Rigó as a gift for Clara, a Parisian chef from a restaurant that hosted Rigó, or a pastry shop in Vienna is unknown.<br />Since its inception, the pastry gained popularity in Hungary and nearby countries, including Croatia and Austria.",
