  ingredients: {

      {
        name: "heavy whipping cream, chilled",
        amount: "1 cup",
      },
      {
        name: "confectioner's sugar",
        amount: "2 tbsp",
      },
      {
        name: "whole milk",
        amount: "1 cup",
      },
      {
        name: "bittersweet dark chocolate",
        amount: "3 oz",
      },
      {
        name: "hot espresso",
        amount: "2 shots",
      },
    ],
  },
  steps: {
    main: [
      "Using a hand mixer, beat the heavy whipping cream with confectioners sugar until it forms stiff peaks, about 1 minute.",
      "In a medium-sized saucepan, warm milk just until it begins to simmer. Add chocolate and whisk together. Continue to whisk over low heat until the mixture begins to thicken a bit, about 1 minute.",
      "In a clear heat-proof glass, create three layers. Pour the hot chocolate on the bottom, followed by a shot of hot espresso. Finally, top with whipped cream and serve warm.",
      "*Nota bene: The key to making a perfect bicerin is to form three distinct layers! In order to avoid 'breaking' the first layer of the hot chocolate, pour the espresso over the back of a spoon so that it gently cascades into the glass. Then, carefully top with the whipped cream. Do not stir!",

  description:
    "Proof that chocolate makes everything better, the bicerin is a layered drink. Made up of coffee, chocolate, and cream, it has been called the official drink of Turin, Italy. It is said the key to a good bicerin is to let each ingredient rest in its own layer instead of mixing them together.<br />",
  history:
    "The authentic bicerin served at the Caffé Confetteria Al Bicerin remains nearly unchanged since its invention in 1764, especially considering the Caffé closely guards the original recipe. The biggest difference from its 18th century version is that each of the coffee, espresso, and chocolate layers are no longer served in separate glasses. Instead, only a single class is used, and care is taken not to prematurely mix the drink's signature layers.",
  notes: [
    "Caffé Confetteria Al Bicerin is located across the street from the Sanctuary of the Consolata, which made this drink rather popular after Sunday Mass and during the Lent season.",
